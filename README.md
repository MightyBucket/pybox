Pybox is  an intergrated development environment (IDE) for the python language, written in python, C, HTML and JS.
In this file, i will be stating every dependencies that will be required to run pybox. Important information will also be stated here.

Pybox is a self-contained project. It will contain parsers, lexers and post-processors that can help with code manipulation and text detection. In the long run, these tools will be used to create a development environment for the python language (...and possible more!) The tools in this project will have minimum dependency and maximum portability over different platforms. Below, I will be stating information such as `dependencies` and `testing` information

## Deps
1.tkinter

## Testing
To test out pybox, simple run the 'zeb.py' file
